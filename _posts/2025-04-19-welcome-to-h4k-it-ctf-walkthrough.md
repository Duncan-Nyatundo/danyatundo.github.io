Hello! This is my write-up for the **PHP-J4G web challenge** from [h4k-it.com](https://h4k-it.com).

---

## Challenge Setup

We‚Äôve been provided with an IP address and a port to access the challenge website.

---

## Step 1: Exploring the Site

After accessing the website, we‚Äôre greeted with a login page that requires a password.

I attempted default credentials and random values, but none were successful.

---

## Step 2: Viewing the Source Code

I decided to view the page source and discovered some hex values embedded in the HTML.

## Step 3: Decoding the Hex

I copied the hex and decoded it using [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/), selecting the "From Hex" operation. This revealed a PHP script.

## Step 4: Analyzing the PHP Script

I examined the PHP script to identify any potential backdoors or useful logic.

Two inputs were suggested in the script: `"VAWULENCE"` and `"a"`.

- Trying `"VAWULENCE"` ‚Üí no success.
- Trying `"a"` ‚Üí **BOOM! Got the flag** üéâ
